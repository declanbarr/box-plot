    "The box plot was created in 1970 by John Tukey however it didn't become widely known until after his book \"Exploratory Data Analysis\", 1977, was published. (Reference - http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/boxplots.pdf) \n",
    "\n",
    "Tukey was also reponsible for coining the term \"Bit\" which is an abbreviation of \"binary digit\", while working as a researcher at AT&Ts Bell Laboratories (Reference - https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/us/john-tukey-85-statistician-coined-the-word-software.html).\n",
