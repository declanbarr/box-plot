## An investigation into box plots

### What's contained in this repository

This repository contains the following files:

* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README.md
* Boxplot.png
* John_Tukey.jpg
* box-plots.ipynb


The box-plots.ipynb file contains the investigation carried into box plots.

### How to run the Jupyter Notebook

For this project I used Anaconda version 5.3 and Python version 3.6.7. Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python used for data science [1]. Anaconda provides a number of libraries. For this project I will be using the following libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and SciPy

The box-plots.ipynb file can be viewed in full on GitHub or can be downloaded and run on your PC. To run on your own machine follow these steps:

* Download the raw .ipynb file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/declanbarr/simulated-dataset/master/simulated-dataset.ipynb
* On the command line change directory into the directory where you saved the ipynb file
* Start jupyter notebook by typing: jupyter notebook

### Project plan

#### Updated plan.

__Saturday 08 December 2018 (4 hours free - 1.5 hours on this project)__
* Situations in which boxplots are used

__Sunday 09 December 2018 (8 hours free - 3 hours on this project)__
* Situations in which boxplots are used
* Relevant terminology

__Monday 10 December 2018 to Thursday (4 hours on this project)__
* Use of boxplots
  * Simulate more data (what kind of distributions?)
  * Use real data sets (research for good examples - skewness, range, IQR etc)
  
__Friday 14 December 2018 (Due Date) (8 hours - 3 hours on this project)__
* Finish history of boxplots
* Read over notebook and check for errors
* Ensure url has been added to website


#### Original plan.

Due date is 14th December 2018

4 weeks until due date. Due date is a Friday. This gives 4 * 5 = 20 weekdays and 3 * 2 = 6 weekends. Taking 13th and 14th off work gives 18 evenings to study and 8 full days (6 weekend days and 2 annual leave days).


#### Week 1

History of Box Plots

Situations in Which Box Plots Are Used

Relevant Terminology


#### Week 2
